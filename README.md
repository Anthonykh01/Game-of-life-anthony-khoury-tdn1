# Grid Simulation Project

## Description

This Python project creates a dynamic grid simulation, reminiscent of Conway's Game of Life. The program generates a grid of cells, each of which can be in one of two states: on or off. The state of each cell evolves over time based on the states of its neighboring cells, following a simple set of rules.
